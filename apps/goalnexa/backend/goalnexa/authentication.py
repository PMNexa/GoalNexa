"""Bearer-JWT DRF authentication - decodes a token issued by any module
sharing the same JWT_SECRET (e.g. platform-auth) WITHOUT looking up a
User row anywhere - this module has no User table of its own (see
models/goal.py's own docstring on "share nothing at the DB level").
Resolves to a lightweight actor stub exposing only `.id` (the JWT's
`sub` claim), which is all this module's views need.

When goalnexa is imported into a host app that ALSO has platform_auth
installed (e.g. apps/main), the host's own DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES
(platform_auth's ActorAuthentication, which resolves a real User row)
takes over instead - this class is only exercised when goalnexa runs
standalone. Either way, this module's views only ever read
`request.user.id`, so which one resolved it is invisible to them.
